# Getting Started with Contextually

Welcome! This tutorial is the best place to start your journey with Contextually. In the next five minutes, you will:

1. Install the `cx` command-line shell.
2. Initialize a sample project on your local machine.
3. Use the interactive shell to connect to a live sample API.
4. Run your first dynamic, blueprint-driven command.

Let's begin!

---

## 1. Installation

First, you need to install the `cx` executable. The easiest way is to download the latest pre-compiled binary for your operating system from our [**GitHub Releases page**](https://github.com/flowcontextually/cx-shell/releases).

Choose the command for your system and run it in your terminal.

### Linux & macOS (Intel)

```bash
# Replace v0.1.0 with the latest version number
VERSION="v0.1.0"
ARCH="x86_64"

curl -L -o cx.tar.gz "https://github.com/flowcontextually/cx-shell/releases/download/${VERSION}/cx-${VERSION}-linux-${ARCH}.tar.gz"
tar -xzf cx.tar.gz
sudo mv cx /usr/local/bin/
cx --version
```

### macOS (Apple Silicon)

```bash
# Replace v0.1.0 with the latest version number
VERSION="v0.1.0"
ARCH="arm64"

curl -L -o cx.tar.gz "https://github.com/flowcontextually/cx-shell/releases/download/${VERSION}/cx-${VERSION}-macos-${ARCH}.tar.gz"
tar -xzf cx.tar.gz
sudo mv cx /usr/local/bin/
cx --version
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Replace v0.1.0 with the latest version number
$version = "v0.1.0"
$output = "cx-setup.exe"
$url = "https://github.com/flowcontextually/cx-shell/releases/download/${version}/cx-setup-${version}.exe"

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $output
./$output
```

> **Success!** If the `cx --version` command prints a version number, you have successfully installed the Contextually Shell.

## 2. Initialize Your Environment

Now, we'll use the `cx init` command to set up your local environment. This command creates a hidden `~/.cx` directory in your user's home folder and populates it with some essential configuration and a sample "Petstore API" project.

Run the command in your terminal:

```bash
cx init
```

You should see output confirming that the directories and sample files have been created. This is a one-time setup step.

---

## 3. Start the Interactive Shell

The `cx` shell is where the magic happens. It's an interactive session that remembers your connections and lets you explore APIs dynamically.

To start it, simply type `cx`:

```bash
cx
```

Your terminal prompt will change to `cx>`, indicating you are now inside the interactive shell.

---

## 4. Connect and Run!

Now let's use the sample project that `init` created for us.

**First, connect to the Petstore API.** We'll use the `connect` command to activate the connection defined in `~/.cx/connections/petstore.conn.yaml` and give it a short, memorable alias for this session: `api`.

```
cx> connect user:petstore --as api
```

You should see a âœ… Connection successful message.

**Finally, run your first blueprint-driven command.** Type `api.` and wait a moment for the autocompletion menu to appear with a list of available actions. Let's run `getPetById` and ask for the pet with an ID of 1.

```
cx> api.getPetById(petId=1)
```

**Congratulations!** You should see a JSON object printed to your screen with the details of the pet.

You have just successfully:

- Loaded a blueprint that defines how to talk to the Petstore API.
- Executed a dynamic action against that API.
- Passed a parameter that was correctly used to build the final URL (`.../pet/1`).

To exit the shell, simply type `exit` or press `Ctrl+D`.
