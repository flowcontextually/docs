# Welcome to Contextually

**The Universal Computational Fabric.** Contextually is a declarative, multi-stage automation platform for modern data and operations teams. It's built around a powerful command-line shell, `cx`, that allows you to interact with any API or data source using simple, version-controlled "blueprints."

Our core philosophy is to eliminate **context fragmentation**â€”the loss of lineage, intent, and nuance when work moves between different tools, people, and AI agents. With Contextually, your workflows become persistent, auditable, and transferable assets.

  Understand the core concepts behind Blueprints, the reusable packages that contain the "knowledge" of how to interact with external services.

## Core Concepts

- **The `cx` Shell:** An interactive REPL that holds the state of your connections, allowing you to chain commands and explore APIs dynamically.
- **Blueprints:** Version-controlled packages that define how to interact with an external service. They are the reusable, shareable core of the ecosystem.
- **The Compiler (`cx compile`):** A powerful tool that takes a machine-readable specification (like OpenAPI) and automatically generates a complete blueprint package.
- **The UNIX Philosophy:** Small, powerful tools (`extract`, `transform`) are composed together using pipes (`|`) to create complex, robust workflows.

## The Big Picture

Contextually is built on three foundational principles:

1.  **Specification-First:** We don't build integrations for services; we build engines for protocols. We onboard new services by ingesting their machine-readable specifications.
2.  **Declarative over Imperative:** All workflows are defined as simple, version-controllable YAML scripts. The _what_ is in the script; the _how_ is in the engine.
3.  **Compose, Don't Command:** Our platform is built on the idea of composing small, powerful tools together to create complex workflows.
